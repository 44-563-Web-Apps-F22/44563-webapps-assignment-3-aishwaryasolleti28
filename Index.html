        <h2>FRICK'S MUSEUM</h2>
        <p>The Frick is one of the preeminent small art museums in the United States, 
            with a high-quality collection of old master paintings and fine furniture housed
             in nineteen galleries of varying size within the former residence.
             <b> Frick had intended the</b> mansion to become a museum eventually,
               and a few of the paintings are still arranged according to Frick's design. 
             Besides its permanent collection, <b>the Frick has</b> always organized small,
              focused temporary exhibitions.</p>
